and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **`full` tool profile breaks OpenAI-compatible providers** (#33)
  - `context_delegate.input.insights` array property was missing required `items` declaration
  - Stricter providers rejected the schema with `invalid_function_parameters`
  - Added `items: { type: 'object', properties: {...} }` to the `insights` property with proper `patterns`, `relationships`, `trends`, and `themes` fields
  - Added `properties: {}` to `context_link.metadata` bare object schema for strict validator compatibility
  - Added regression test that validates all array properties across all tool schemas have `items` declared
  - Added comprehensive E2E test suite that spawns the actual MCP server and validates tool schemas, tool calls, and error handling over stdio

## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- **Server crashes with SQLITE_CANTOPEN when parent process CWD changes** (#31)
  - Server now resolves database path to an absolute location (`$DATA_DIR` or `~/mcp-data/memory-keeper/`) instead of relying on CWD
  - Added try/catch around data directory creation with actionable error message
  - Startup warning with exact `cp` command when legacy `context.db` detected in CWD
  - README "from source" install command now points to `bin/mcp-memory-keeper` instead of `node dist/index.js`
  - Added Upgrading section documenting database path change and migration steps

### Technical

- Fixed integration tests to use `DATA_DIR` instead of dead `MCP_DB_PATH` environment variable
- Fixed `git.init()` in tests to use `--initial-branch=master` for deterministic behavior

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- **Selective Tool Filtering via Profiles** (#29)
  - Control which tools are exposed to reduce context window usage (~10-15K tokens saved with minimal profile)
  - Three built-in profiles: `minimal` (8 tools), `standard` (22 tools), `full` (38 tools, default)
  - `TOOL_PROFILE` environment variable to select active profile at startup
  - `TOOL_PROFILE_CONFIG` environment variable to specify custom config file path
  - Custom profile definitions via `~/.mcp-memory-keeper/config.json`
  - Config file profiles take precedence over built-in defaults
  - Helpful error messages when disabled tools are called, with guidance on enabling them
  - Startup logging shows active profile, tool count, and source
  - Example config file included in `examples/config.json`

### Technical

- New `src/utils/tool-profiles.ts` module with `ALL_TOOL_NAMES` source of truth
- `ToolName` union type for compile-time safety
- Deep config validation (guards against malformed JSON, null values, non-array profiles, non-string elements)
- Drift-detection integration test verifies `ALL_TOOL_NAMES` stays in sync with `index.ts` tool definitions
- Defense-in-depth: both `ListTools` filtering and `CallTool` guard for disabled tools
- 100% backwards compatible — no env var + no config = all 38 tools (existing behavior unchanged)
- All 1185 tests passing across Node.js 20, 22, and 24

## [0.11.0] - 2025-12-10

  - Prebuilt binaries now available for Node.js 20, 22, and 24
  - Resolves `gyp ERR!` build failures on Node.js 24
